DINO GAME:
The Chrome dino game is a simple infinite runner, which sees you jump over cacti, and dodge underneath obstacles. An often-overlooked Easter Egg in Google Chrome is the dinosaur game, which appears when you try to visit a website while disconnected from the Internet.
BUT one issue in this is that while storing the cookie for showing high score .In chrome it is not updated because by default chrome does not allow to store cookies.So I reccomend to play this game on mozilla .
